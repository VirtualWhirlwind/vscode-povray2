# POV-Ray Extension v2 for Visual Studio Code

(https://github.com/VirtualWhirlwind/vscode-povray2)

The [Persistence of Vision Raytracer](http://povray.org) is a high-quality, free software tool for creating three-dimensional graphics by using a Scene Description Language.

This extension allows you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to edit POV-Ray Scene Description files and render them using POV-Ray in the integrated terminal.

## Getting Started

* After installing POV-Ray and this extension, open the Extension Settings and be sure to fill in:
    * Library Path
    * Pvengine Path
* Start creating .pov files and use the "P" button in the upper right to trigger rendering
* Rendering errors are not shown in VSCode yet, you need to open the pov file in the POV-Ray editor to see scene problems

## Requirements

*This extension does not install POV-Ray*. You need to install it yourself. (Docker support suspended pending further testing)

* Please check the extension settings to configure the POV-Ray engine path.

### **Installing POV-Ray**

You will need to install POV-Ray for your specific OS and you will need to make sure that it can be run via the commandline from your terminal.

#### Ubuntu Linux

    sudo apt install povray

#### Windows 10 with WSL

For the best experience on Windows, install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) and **Ubuntu for Windows**. Then [configure VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_configuration) to use `C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe` as the integrated shell. Once you have WSL and Ubuntu working, you can install the povray package for Ubuntu exactly the same as above.

#### Windows 
Download and run the POV-Ray installer for Windows:

http://www.povray.org/download/

Make sure the full path to `pvengine.exe` is added to your `PATH` Environment Variable so that it can be run from Powershell or the Windows command line.

You may also have to turn off `Script I/O Restrictions` in the POV-Ray Options.

#### Mac

Download the unofficial **Command line POV-Ray 3.7.0 final** for Mac:

http://megapov.inetart.net/povrayunofficial_mac/finalpov.html

Using the terminal, unzip the downloaded file and move the extracted files into `~/povray` :

    unzip PovrayCommandLineMacV2.zip && mv PovrayCommandLineMacV2 ~/povray

Create a `povray` symlink in `/usr/local/bin` to run `Povray37UnofficialMacCmd` :

    ln -s ~/povray/Povray37UnofficialMacCmd /usr/local/bin/povray

Modify the POV-Ray Extension Settings in VS Code to set the Library Path to `~/povray/include`
